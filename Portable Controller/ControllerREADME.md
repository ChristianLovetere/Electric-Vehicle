A subproject of the car project. This portable controller has a power on/off switch for ease of use and a USB-C charger slot so that it can be charged by any generic USB-C charger. It contains the REYAX RYLR896 RF module for transmitting to the Electric Vehicle, an HD44780 LCD screen with I2C backpack, raspberry pi 3, 5V 2.5A power bank, and a 3DConnexion SpaceMouse for input.
